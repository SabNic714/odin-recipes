        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is easy to cook and only has a few ingredients. You can easily cook this on a busy night when you want something healthy but flavorful. </p>
        <p>This dish uses jasmine rice at the base. Jasmine rice provides a rich, flavorful rice that will mix well with the sweetness and tanginess of the stir fry sauce you will use with the vegetables of your choice (<em>I have some great recommendations below!</em>) and the beef.</p>
